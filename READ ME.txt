ABOUT THE PROJECT

The addition of polynomials using linked list in C code involves creating a linked list for each polynomial and then adding the corresponding terms of each polynomial. The result is stored in a new linked list
The power of the coefficient of the two polynomial to add the polynomial of the linked list.
The structure of the node in the linked list contains two elements: the coefficient of the term and the exponent of the term.
