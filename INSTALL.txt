HOW TO USE
The addition of polynomials using linked list in C code involves creating a linked list for each polynomial and then adding the corresponding terms of each polynomial. The result is stored in a new linked list.
The structure of the node in the linked list contains two elements: the coefficient of the term and the exponent of the term.
